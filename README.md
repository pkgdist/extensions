## Repository Template for Deno

[![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI%20build%20passing-green)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lynsei/devcontainer.deno)
[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/orchestras/deno)

### What is this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This is a microservice template for DENO

This project is a re-usable repository template for Typescript using Deno
deployment environment for edge-compiled applications. It is ideally suited for
Github actions and composite workflows because it compiles single-purpose binary
CLIs that are easily released with Brew using a Tap.

This makes distribution very simple, as any action can re-utilize the homebrew
tap to install the latest release from Github releases.

### Supported Platforms

- darwin
  - amd64
  - arm64
- linux
  - amd64
  - arm64
- windows
  - amd64
  - -arm64- (unsupported)
