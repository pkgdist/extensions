# Extensions

Release notes for the `@softdist/extension` system: An abstract extension system
for inspection of Github scopes.

- Package: [@softdist/extensions](https://jsr.io/@softdist/extensions)
- Repository: [@pkgdist/extensions](https://github.com/pkgdist/extensions)

## Version 0.2.7

[![JSR release (latest)](https://img.shields.io/badge/JSR-module-hotpink)](https://jsr.io/@softdist/extensions)
[![GitHub release (latest)](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/pkgdist/extensions)

> [!IMPORTANT]

> PATCH UPDATE

* This patch version `0.2.7` addresses the lack of a function for finding paths and values: `findParamPaths`
* It also addresses the need for a set of generic-type data objects for json based on:

```bash
repos: { 
  repo: [
    { 
      entry1: unknown, 
      entry2: unknown 
      entry3: unknown
    }
  ] 
}
```

The reporting object can now be extended by using custom exceptions or other
object types, and by simply passing any functions as hooks to the `createReport`
function.

### Custom Object Types in 0.2.6

Passing custom objects to the `createReport` function is now trivial.

#### Extending createReportEntry\<custom\>

You can easily use the generic reporting object by instantiating it with a
custom type.

The example below illustrates how custom `Exception` error reporting objects are
passed to the Reporting class:

```typescript
// a custom error exception called Exception:
export type Exception = Error | string | Record<string, unknown>
// a custom HookExample function call to illustrate passing as a hook:
export async function HookExample(entry: string = '') {
  console.log(entry)
}

export const report = await createReport(
  [
    async (entry) => {
      await HookExample( // pass function as hook
        `Test Function`,
      )
    },
  ],
  'report_aggregate.json', // specify report JSON file
)
// add an entry to the 'example_report' with error type <Exception> for <ReportEntryWithErrors>
await report.addEntry(
  'example_report',
  createReportEntry<ReportEntryWithErrors<Exception>>({
    score: 3,
    rule: 'example_rule',
    description: 'This is an example rule',
    repo: 'test_repo',
    path: '',
    success: true,
    error: { error: 'test error' },
  }),
)
```

### Github Scopes Update. 0.2.4 - 0.2.5

> Expect a lot more of these types of features for detecting Github settings.

This is the first in the group, and it deals with Github Repository Rulesets,
Rules, and their parameters.

- **Ruleset checks**
  - Tests for Rulesets
- Documentation improvements
  - Improved Release Notes and Readme
  - Added Licensing Notes
- Token complexity reduction
  - Token graceful fallback improvements
  - Dependency reduction
- Housekeeping
  - Updated scripts
  - Updated Makefile
  - Bumped version
- Ruleset features
  - Branch Protection for status checks to pass
  - Branch Protection for up-to-date requirement
  - Copilot Code Review enabled
  - Any other rule can be determined by using a `JSON_PATH`

### Examples

| TITLE                      | JSON_PATH                                                  | DESCRIPTION                                                  |

| require-branch-up-to-date  | `rulesets.0.requireBranchesUpToDate`                       | Require that the PR is up to date with any changes at origin |
| require-copilot-review     | `rulesets.0.copilotCodeReviewEnabled`                      | Require copilot code review on PR                            |
| require-params-code-review | `rules.2.parameters.automatic_copilot_code_review_enabled` | Require PR code review in rule parameters                    |

## Generic Comparison & Reporting Functions

This system is a generic comparison and reporting module that plugs into
external systems we manage. It contains no private data nor proprietary
information. It is specifically for calling error display, report scoring, deep
object comparison, and other helper functions that are generic and
multi-purpose.

### Features

> [!TIP]
> Use a generic `import * as exts from 'jsr:@softdist/extensions@0.2.X'` and it
> will automatically retrieve all the modules we export below:

## Exported Modules

| Feature Name | Purpose                                                                                   |

| `$colors`    | Automatic error logging and warn/notice stream logging with colors                        |
| `$const`     | Declared generic constants for local system paths and GITHUB API                          |
| `$compare`   | Comparison functions for deep YML objects.                                                |
| `$error`     | Generic error functions for including messages with specific colors                       |

| `$report`    | Reporting function for scoring tabulation in streams, and notification functions in teams |
| `$streams`   | Optic FileStream object for logging colored error messages to evaluated streams           |
| `$token`     | Token acquisition for GitHub CLI default, or .envcrypt files, or environment vars         |
| `$webhook`   | Webhook secret acquisition IFFE functions                                                 |

## Exported Variables

| Variable           | Description                         |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `generatedVersion` | Software Version Information        |
| `Type`             | Types used throughout this software |

Each registry of rules will be published in the engine itself, not this module.\
The purpose of this module is to abstract any reporting or evaluation features
into re-usable interfaces so they may be called in dynamic code evaluations in
Deno without the necessity to write Typescript code to the user's computer.

## About FileStream

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** This code relies on MIT licensed objects from `jsr:@onjara/optic`.

FileStreams 2.0.3 currently has a bug that disallows the use of FileStream
objects from import statements, as there is no `mod.ts` file
[here](https://github.com/onjara/optic/tree/master/streams/fileStream). Once
this bug is fixed we will remove the inclusion of optic code directly in our
package. (it's a stop gap measure)
