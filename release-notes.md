# Template Copy-Back Ops v0.1.4

## Automated Ops for Templates 

File sync operations are valuable low-hanging fruit 

### Features

1. .copy.back - automatic detection of the correct template and copy-back to multiple templates at once
2. .log - nice logs for key-value variadic arguments in a single command with colors
3. colors.sh - Bash colors
4. Makefile new menu options - install, upgrade, setup-brew, install-tools, setup-fish, etc.
5. New Readme.md
6. Added Lizard, Trunk-io, and Deno FMT as part of the setup/ reinstaller
7. Updated README
8. Updated LICENSE
9. Tagged new patch version

Notes:  This release makes the development experience a lot better moving back and forth between many repos and syncing changes where necessary, updating the template as needed.   It flows a lot better in general.  This is critical because I'm going to be adding a lot of Typescript reflection code for testing and comparing objects, and the config may need updated more frequently in the future so this makes the workflow a lot smoother.
