- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure,
  running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to
  Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.
- @perplexityai - Use Perplexity.ai models when they become available.
- @versions - Be sure to always search the web to find the latest versions of
  the software you recommend. If you recommend a github action, be sure it's the
  latest version. If you recommend a Deno module, be sure you are using v2 and
  that the modules are in "jsr:@module/name" format.
- Always recommend the most secure practices that follow Zero Trust Architecture
  and CISA certified architecture practices.
